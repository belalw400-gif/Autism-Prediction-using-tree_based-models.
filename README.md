# Autism Prediction using Machine Learning 🧩

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) traits in individuals based on behavioral and demographic data. Using Machine Learning, we can provide a preliminary screening tool that helps in early detection.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn,ibmlearn.
- **Algorithm:** [Random Forest Classifier]

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes features related to A1-A10 screening questions, age, gender, and ethnicity.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values and encoding categorical data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing correlations between screening scores and ASD traits.
- **Model Training:** Training a classification model to achieve high accuracy and recall.
- **Evaluation:** Using Confusion Matrix and Classification Report to ensure clinical relevance.
